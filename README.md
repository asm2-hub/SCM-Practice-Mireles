# SCM-Practice-Mireles
This project demonstrates the concept of Source Code Management (SCM) using GitHub. SCM is the 
practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. It includes effective developer collaboration 
 and manages code versions.

**SCM..**<br />
Source Code Management (SCM) is a method of tracking and controlling changes to software code. It allows 
multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. 
SCM also provides version control, making it easier to revert to previous code states when necessary.

Commonly used SCM tools include Git. It is widely adopted due to its flexibility and speed. The benefits of 
SCM are the collaboration, version control, and its branching and merging funtions. The collaboration 
allows developers to work together on the same project from different locations. Version control allows 
track changes, roll back to previous versions, and manages multiple versions of the codebase. Lasting branch
and merging functions create isolated work environments for new features, bug fixes, and experiments, and 
later merge them into the main project.

**How Github helps..** <br />
GitHub provides a platform for developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code repositories. Git is 
labeled as a distributed version control system. Source Code Management (SCM) leverages Git to track 
changes to the codebase over time. It's known for its simplicity to revert to previous versions or comparing 
different versions. GitHub enhances collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same 
project simultaneously, using features like branches, pull requests, and issue tracking. These tools help 
manage code changes, review contributions, and merge updates smoothly. This leads to improved productivity, 
steamlines team workflows, and  minimizes the risk of code conflicts.
